                                <p>Jason Statham was born on 26 July 1967 in Shirebrook, Derbyshire, the son of dancer
                                    Eileen (née Yates) and street seller Barry Statham. His father also worked odd jobs
                                    as a
                                    house painter, coal miner, and singer in the Canary Islands. Statham moved to Great
                                    Yarmouth, Norfolk, where he initially chose not to follow his father's career
                                    working
                                    the local market stalls, instead practising martial arts. He grew up with football
                                    player Vinnie Jones, alongside whom he would later act. Jones introduced him to
                                    football, and Statham went on to play for the local grammar school (1978–1983),
                                    which he
                                    had attended since age 11, a passion that he shared with diving. He practised daily
                                    in
                                    perfecting his diving techniques, and was a member of Britain's National Swimming
                                    Squad
                                    for 12 years. He competed for England at the 1990 Commonwealth Games in the 10
                                    metre, 3
                                    metre, and 1 metre competitions. He said in a 2003 interview with IGN that his time
                                    with
                                    the national squad was "a great experience" and one that "teaches you discipline,
                                    focus,
                                    and certainly keeps you out of trouble".

                                    Typecast as an antihero, he is known for action-thriller films and portraying tough,
                                    irredeemable, and machiavellian characters.
                                    Statham began practising Chinese martial arts, kickboxing, and karate recreationally
                                    in
                                    his youth while working at local market stalls.
                                    An avid footballer and diver, he was a member of Britain's national diving team and
                                    competed for England in the 1990 Commonwealth Games.
                                    Shortly after, he was asked to model for French Connection, Tommy Hilfiger, and
                                    Levi's
                                    in various advertising campaigns.
                                    His past history working at market stalls inspired his casting in the Guy Ritchie
                                    crime
                                    films Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998) and Snatch (2000).
                                    The commercial success of these films led Statham to star as Frank Martin in the
                                    Transporter trilogy (2002–2008).
                                    After starring in a variety of heist and action-thriller films such as The Italian

                                    and Mechanic: Resurrection (2016), he established himself as a Hollywood leading
                                    man.
                                    However, he has also starred in commercially and critically unsuccessful films such
                                    as
                                    Revolver (2005), Chaos (2005), In the Name of the King (2007), 13 (2010), Blitz

                                    He regained commercial success as a part of the ensemble action series The
                                    Expendables
                                    (2010–2014) and the Fast & Furious franchise.
                                    In the latter, he has played Deckard Shaw in Fast & Furious 6 (2013), Furious 7
                                    (2015),
                                    The Fate of the Furious (2017), and the spin-off Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs &

                                    credit.
                                    Statham's acting has been criticised for lacking depth and variety, but he has also
                                    been
                                    praised for leading the resurgence of action films during the 2000s and 2010s.
                                    According to a BBC News report, his film career from 2002 to 2017 generated an

                                    $1.5 billion (£1.1 billion) in ticket sales, making him one of the film industry's
                                    most
                                    bankable stars.

                                                the science fiction martial arts action film The One.<br>
                                                Statham was offered more film roles, and in 2002 he was cast as the lead
                                                role of driver Frank Martin in the action movie The Transporter, written

                                                In 2005, Statham was once again cast by Ritchie to star in his new
                                                project,
                                                Revolver, which was a critical and box office failure.

                                                Statham was asked to promote Crank during the 2006 San Diego Comic-Con
                                                Convention.[23] In 2008, Statham starred in the British crime thriller
                                                The
                                                Bank Job and Death Race, a remake of Death Race 2000 (1975).
                                                American film critic Armond White hailed Statham's ascension as an
                                                action
                                                film star. On the occasion of Death Race, White championed Statham's
                                                "best
                                                track record of any contemporary movie star.
                                                "Later in 2008, White praised Statham's Transporter 3 as a great example
                                                of
                                                kinetic pop art.<br>
                                                Chris Hewitt of Empire Magazine, noted the film as "a dour, drab
                                                affair",
                                                but credited the film with "establishing Statham as a new action hero,
                                                as at
                                                ease with gruff one-liners as he was with Jackie Chan-esque
                                                high-kicking".
                                                In 2009, Statham started to develop a new movie written by David Peoples
                                                and
                                                Janet Peoples. Statham stated "We've got a movie we're trying to do,
                                                written
                                                by David Peoples and Janet Peoples, in the vein of an old film, The
                                                Treasure
                                                of the Sierra Madre.
                                                It's not a remake or anything, but it's a little bit like that, about
                                                relationships and how greed contaminates the relationships these three
                                                people have. The working title is The Grabbers."[26] He reprised his
                                                role as
                                                Chev Chelios in the 2009 sequel Crank: High Voltage.
                                                In 2010, Statham appeared alongside fellow action stars Sylvester

                                                soldier and expert at close quarters combat using knives.
